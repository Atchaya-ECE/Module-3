# Module-3
# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.
[153,147,124,102]


## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
l=[153,147,124,102]
sum=0
for i in l:
     sum=sum+i
print(sum)
```


## Output
